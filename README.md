# CardMaker

Rough 1.0 version of my cardmaker for a drinking game

this early version is usable but has some oddities that should be kept in mind:

  - Images should be 223x150, if this is not the case the final product will be rendered incorrect
  - If the title or card text are too long, the text will not be rendered correctly on the card
  - When entering a filename, do not enter the filetype (.jpg/.png), this will be done automatically
  - images will be saved in same folder as the used jar file

I will implement a more refined version later.
